# Queue From Stacks

Problem: Implement a queue using two stacks.

## Requirements

- Do we expect the methods to be enqueue and dequeue?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a stack class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Can we push a None value to the Stack?
  - No
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Enqueue and dequeue on empty stack
- Enqueue and dequeue on non-empty stack
- Multiple enqueue in a row
- Multiple dequeue in a row
- Enqueue after a dequeue
- Dequeue after an enqueue
