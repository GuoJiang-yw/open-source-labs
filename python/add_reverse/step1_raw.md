# Add Reverse

Problem: Add two numbers whose digits are stored in a linked list in reverse order.

## Requirements

- Can we assume this is a non-circular, singly linked list?
  - Yes
- Do we expect the return to be in reverse order too?
  - Yes
- What if one of the inputs is None?
  - Return None for an invalid operation
- How large are these numbers--can they fit in memory?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits in memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Empty list(s) -> None
- Add values of different lengths
  - Input 1: 6->5->None
  - Input 2: 9->8->7
  - Result: 5->4->8
- Add values of same lengths
  - Exercised from values of different lengths
  - Done here for completeness
