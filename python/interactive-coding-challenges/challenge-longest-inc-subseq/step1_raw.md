# Longest Inc Subseq

Problem: Find the longest increasing subsequence.

## Requirements

- Are duplicates possible?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the inputs are integers?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the inputs are valid?
  - No
- Do we expect the result to be an array of the longest increasing subsequence?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- None -> Exception
- [] -> []
- [3, 4, -1, 0, 6, 2, 3] -> [-1, 0, 2, 3]
