# Compress

Problem: Compress a string such that 'AAABCCDDDD' becomes 'A3BC2D4'. Only compress the string if it saves space.

## Requirements

- Can we assume the string is ASCII?
  - Yes
  - Note: Unicode strings could require special handling depending on your language
- Is this case sensitive?
  - Yes
- Can we use additional data structures?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits in memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- None -> None
- '' -> ''
- 'AABBCC' -> 'AABBCC'
- 'AAABCCDDDD' -> 'A3BC2D4'
