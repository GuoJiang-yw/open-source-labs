# Palindrome

Problem: Determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

## Requirements

- Can we assume this is a non-circular, singly linked list?
  - Yes
- Is a single character or number a palindrome?
  - No
- Can we assume we already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Can we use additional data structures?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits in memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Empty list -> False
- Single element list -> False
- Two or more element list, not a palindrome -> False
- General case: Palindrome with even length -> True
- General case: Palindrome with odd length -> True
