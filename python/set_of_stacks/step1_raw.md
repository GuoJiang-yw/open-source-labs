# Set Of Stacks

Problem: Implement SetOfStacks that wraps a list of stacks, where each stack is bound by a capacity.

## Requirements

- Can we assume we already have a stack class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Are all stack bound by the same capacity?
  - Yes
- If a stack becomes full, should automatically create one?
  - Yes
- If a stack becomes empty, should we delete it?
  - Yes
- If we pop on an empty stack, should we return None?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Push and pop on an empty stack
- Push and pop on a non-empty stack
- Push on a capacity stack to create a new one
- Pop on a stack to destroy it
