# Sort Stack

Problem: Sort a stack. You can use another stack as a buffer.

## Requirements

- When sorted, should the largest element be at the top or bottom?
  - Top
- Can you have duplicate values like 5, 5?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a stack class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Empty stack -> None
- One element stack
- Two or more element stack (general case)
- Already sorted stack
