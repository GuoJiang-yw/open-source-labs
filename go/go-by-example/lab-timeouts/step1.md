# Timeouts

## Problem

When programs connect to external resources or need to bound execution time, timeouts are important. The challenge is to implement timeouts in Go using channels and `select`.

## Requirements

- Implement timeouts in Go using channels and `select`.
- Use a buffered channel to prevent goroutine leaks in case the channel is never read.
- Use `time.After` to await a value to be sent after the timeout.
- Use `select` to proceed with the first receive that's ready.

## Example

```sh
# Running this program shows the first operation timing
# out and the second succeeding.
$ go run timeouts.go
timeout 1
result 2
```

## Solution

```go
// _Timeouts_ are important for programs that connect to
// external resources or that otherwise need to bound
// execution time. Implementing timeouts in Go is easy and
// elegant thanks to channels and `select`.

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {

	// For our example, suppose we're executing an external
	// call that returns its result on a channel `c1`
	// after 2s. Note that the channel is buffered, so the
	// send in the goroutine is nonblocking. This is a
	// common pattern to prevent goroutine leaks in case the
	// channel is never read.
	c1 := make(chan string, 1)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c1 <- "result 1"
	}()

	// Here's the `select` implementing a timeout.
	// `res := <-c1` awaits the result and `<-time.After`
	// awaits a value to be sent after the timeout of
	// 1s. Since `select` proceeds with the first
	// receive that's ready, we'll take the timeout case
	// if the operation takes more than the allowed 1s.
	select {
	case res := <-c1:
		fmt.Println(res)
	case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("timeout 1")
	}

	// If we allow a longer timeout of 3s, then the receive
	// from `c2` will succeed and we'll print the result.
	c2 := make(chan string, 1)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		c2 <- "result 2"
	}()
	select {
	case res := <-c2:
		fmt.Println(res)
	case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("timeout 2")
	}
}

```
