# Matrix Mult

Problem: Given a list of 2x2 matrices, minimize the cost of matrix multiplication.

## Requirements

- Do we just want to calculate the cost and not list the actual order of operations?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the inputs are valid?
  - No
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- None -> Exception
- [] -> 0
- [Matrix(2, 3), Matrix(3, 6), Matrix(6, 4), Matrix(4, 5)] -> 124
