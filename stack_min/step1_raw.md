# Stack Min

Problem: Implement a stack with push, pop, and min methods running O(1) time.

## Requirements

- Can we assume this is a stack of ints?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the input values for push are valid?
  - Yes
- If we call this function on an empty stack, can we return sys.maxsize?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a stack class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Push/pop on empty stack
- Push/pop on non-empty stack
- Min on empty stack
- Min on non-empty stack
