# Delete Mid

Problem: Delete a node in the middle, given only access to that node.

## Requirements

- Can we assume this is a non-circular, singly linked list?
  - Yes
- What if the final node is being deleted, do we make it a dummy with value None?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a linked list class that can be used for this problem?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- Delete on empty list -> None
- Delete None -> None
- Delete on one node -> [None]
- Delete on multiple nodes
