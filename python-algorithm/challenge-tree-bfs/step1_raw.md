Problem: Implement breadth-first traversal on a binary tree.

- [Constraints](#Constraints)
- [Test Cases](#Test-Cases)
- [Algorithm](#Algorithm)
- [Code](#Code)
- [Unit Test](#Unit-Test)

## Requirements

- Can we assume we already have a Node class with an insert method?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits in memory?
  - Yes
- What should we do with each node when we process it?
  - Call an input method `visit_func` on the node

## Example Usage

### Breadth-First Traversal

- 5, 2, 8, 1, 3 -> 5, 2, 8, 1, 3
