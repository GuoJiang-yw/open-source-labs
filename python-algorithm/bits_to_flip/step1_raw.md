# Bits To Flip

Problem: Determine the number of bits to flip to convert int a to int b'.

## Requirements

- Can we assume A and B are always ints?
  - Yes
- Is the output an int?
  - Yes
- Can we assume A and B are always the same number of bits?
  - Yes
- Can we assume the inputs are valid (not None)?
  - No
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- A or B is None -> Exception
- General case

````txt
    A = 11101
    B = 01111
    Result: 2
```txt
````
