# Summary

In this Python challenge, we learned how to check if a ransom note could have been written using the letters in a magazine. We created a Python function that takes in two strings as arguments and returns `True` if the ransom note could have been written using the letters in the magazine, and `False` otherwise. We also kept in mind the requirements of the problem, such as the case sensitivity and the fact that we are working with ASCII characters.
