# Fibonacci

Problem: Implement fibonacci recursively, dynamically, and iteratively.

## Requirements

- Does the sequence start at 0 or 1?
  - 0
- Can we assume the inputs are valid non-negative ints?
  - Yes
- Are you looking for a recursive or iterative solution?
  - Implement both
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- n = 0 -> 0
- n = 1 -> 1
- n = 6 -> 8
- Fib sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
