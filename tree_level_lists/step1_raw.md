# Tree Level Lists

Problem: Create a list for each level of a binary tree.

## Requirements

- Is this a binary search tree?
  - Yes
- Should each level be a list of nodes?
  - Yes
- Can we assume we already have a Node class with an insert method?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

- 5, 3, 8, 2, 4, 1, 7, 6, 9, 10, 11 -> [[5], [3, 8], [2, 4, 7, 9], [1, 6, 10], [11]]

Note: Each number in the result is actually a node containing the number
