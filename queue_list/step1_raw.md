## Requirements

- If there is one item in the list, do you expect the first and last pointers to both point to it?
  - Yes
- If there are no items on the list, do you expect the first and last pointers to be None?
  - Yes
- If you dequeue on an empty queue, does that return None?
  - Yes
- Can we assume this fits memory?
  - Yes

## Example Usage

### Enqueue

- Enqueue to a non-empty queue

### Dequeue

- Dequeue a queue with one element
- Dequeue a queue with more than one element
