# Summary

The Utopian Tree problem is a mathematical problem that involves calculating the height of a tree after a certain number of growth cycles. The problem requires the programmer to write a function that takes the number of growth cycles as input and returns the height of the tree after those cycles. The problem is commonly used in programming challenges to test the ability of programmers to solve mathematical problems using code.
