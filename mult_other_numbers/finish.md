# Summary

In this Python challenge, we learned how to find the products of every other integer for each index in a list of integers. We also learned how to handle edge cases such as empty lists and lists with only one element or a zero. By following the requirements, we were able to solve this problem without using division and assuming that the solution fits memory.
